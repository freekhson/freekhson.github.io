		<h1>Why human can't fly</h1>
		<h2>14 June ,2017</h2>
		<p>These day I've studied about eletronic motors.<br/>
			I surprised when I saw <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_9-V73nT1k">Siemens's Electric Extra 330 Aircraft</a>
			, it has light weight and 350-hourse power!<br/>
			obiously the airplane can fly short time , but I come to me belive eletronic motor is very efficient. (more than 80%) <br/> and easy to control, can experiment in home without air polution.<br/>
			At the moment, I think what if I can fly or I can feel in the sky with my wing, it really cool. <br/>
			so I searched history who already tried. and found it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VPvKl6ezyc">Jet-man</a><br/>
			It also have abstacle what need airplane at first to land. <br/>
			Next, I also searched about actually human fly, and found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29ebUgUUOE">human bird wing<a/><br/>
			Sadly, it turns out all fake. however, many people want to take off the land easily with safe efficient. <br/>
			I think that's why these day people develop drone shape airbus.
			In my effort, I digging eletonic motor and lt's really scrach step. <br/>
			I need check physics, eletronic motor, aircraft, and software to verify.
			check my work out later!

		<h1>Perfectness</h1>
		<h2>23 July ,2017</h2>
		<p>Everyone want to be perfect in somthing.<br/>
			In there life, or score, test, love...<br/>
			But suddenly, they realize it so hard, they can't get perfectness.<br/>
			I also one of them. I set goal to get skill about english, engineering, however only within 2 month, I gave up alomost.<br/>
			Why it happend? becuase it's not only hard but also lack of hapiness.<br/>
			IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL.</br>
			although, I know I should keep struggle. In my life only this time, not forever.
			Perfect is not always right. To be perfect is always right.</br>
